# Demos

Some demo python scripts:

- `image.py` shows off the `image` module.  Displays a generated image and
  allows scrolling around it.
- `view_file.py` allows loading an image file and scrolling around it.
- `tile.py` shows off the `tiler` module.  Diplays an infinite plane of
  generated tiles, and allows scrolling around it with the mouse.
