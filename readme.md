# TileWindow

Uses `tkinter` (*) to allow displaying a large or infinite image built out of
"tiles":
  - Mimic internet mapping applications in Python.
  - Explore procedurally generated images.






### Why `tkinter`?

Yes, I know, it's ugly (actually, okay on Windows; very ugly using Anaconda on linux),
and unfashionable.  It's not exactly fun to write `tkinter` code.
But it's part of the Python standard library, and there is something
to be said for "it just works".
